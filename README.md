# Across the Universe in Trivia

Across the Universe in Trivia is a Trivia Quiz made with JavaScript and the jQuery library for a class project. This is all part of a homework assignment for UCLA's Fullstack Web Development Coding Bootcamp (September 2019 to March 2020).

The game begins by offering a player the option to select the start button. Upon selecting the start button, a timer counting down from 30 seconds appears along with the first of the trivia questions. Each question has four possible answers, and each answer will highlight when hovered over. Selecting an answer will immediately stop the timer in its count down and take the player to an answer div with no page refresh, stating if they are correct or incorrect. If a player does not select an answer before the timer reaches zero, this answer div will instead state they ran out of time and display the correct answer.

There are seven questions this quiz will offer. After all seven questions have been shown (and answered or not as the player decides), a final tally of correct answers, incorrect answers, and timed out questions will be displayed. There will also be an option to select a reset button, thus playing the game again without refreshing the page. This is achieved by resetting various variables to zero, resetting the timer, and thus resetting the game to start.
